# Introduce yourself

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

My name is Melanie Tong. Iâ€™m from Vancouver, Canada. 

I Iâ€™m pursuing a career in development as itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve loved to do ever since I was in elementary school when I used to design and code my own websites. I attended Simon Fraser University for interaction design for a few years, during which I learned more about programming through courses in Python and Java. Eventually, I realized that programming and development was something I wanted to pursue instead of design.

In 2021, I made the difficult decision to leave university to follow my passion and attend Lighthouse Labs, a bootcamp for full-stack web development. At the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to learn Node, React, SQL, testing, and other parts of creating an app's frontend and backend. Two major team projects I worked on at Lighthouse Labs included a Pinterest copy and an app that displays Canadian House of Commons votes and compares them to user votes. 

Ever since I completed the bootcamp, Iâ€™ve been working on side projects and trying to get my first development job. Iâ€™m currently working on a restaurant ordering system project, as well as a project with a team to create a website for developers and designers to connect and collaborate with each other. I still love design too, so Iâ€™m often making digital graphics like posters and TikTok filters as hobbies as well.

Aside from the above, I love traveling and exploring new places, gaming, outdoorsy activities like kayaking, and hanging out with my cat.

Trying to get my first development job hasnâ€™t been easy, especially without a degree in Computer Science, which is why I believe IGNâ€™s Code Foo is the perfect opportunity for me to break into the field and learn more from the knowledgeable and experienced engineers at the IGN. Additionally, I believe I would make an excellent choice for the program because of my experience creating full-stack applications, my experience working on development teams, and the fact that Iâ€™m always eager to learn and become a better developer. Also, I can contribute to Code Foo by bringing my design background, customer service skills from my experience working in several retail positions, and my team and leadership skills from participating in school clubs.

I'm familiar with IGN because theyâ€™re one of the largest communities for gamers. All the gaming news I learn about comes from IGN, especially from its Youtube channel. When Iâ€™m gaming, Iâ€™m a completionist, so IGNâ€™s walkthroughs and guides are a lifesaver for me. I would love to be a part of IGNâ€™s team and help continue its presence in the gaming community.

Thank you for your consideration,

Melanie Tong
